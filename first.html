<h1>GIRL CHILD EDUCATION</h1>

<p style="color:blueviolet">Most of the parents in rural areas are now convinced to send their girl to school, but it is important that girls complete all the required levels of education, learn additional skills and competencies to show the same level of competition in the labour market.</p>
<p style="color:coral">Education helps shape the independent thinking of girls so that they can make their own life decisions on their own and differentiate between right and wrong so that they can contribute to social development.</p>
<H2>Problems faced by girls in society</H2>
<ul>
<li>dowry issues</li>
<li>girl child murder</li>
<li>rape issues</li>

<p style="background; color:pink">"Dowry" in the sense of the expression contemplated by Dowry Prohibition Act is a demand for property of valuable security having an inextricable nexus with the marriage, i.e., it is a consideration from the side of the bride's parents or relatives to the groom or his parents and/or guardian for the agreement to wed the bride-to-be.

    Article 3 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 specifies that the penalty for giving or taking dowry does not apply to presents that are given at the time of a marriage to the bride or groom is when no demand for them has been made
    
    Although Indian laws against dowries have been in effect for decades, they have been largely criticised as being ineffective.[11] The practice of dowry deaths and murders continues to take place unchecked in many parts of India, which has further added to the concerns of enforcement.[12]
    
    Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code required the groom and his family to be automatically arrested if a wife complains of dowry harassment. The law was widely abused, and in 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that arrests cannot be made without a magistrate's approval.</p>
